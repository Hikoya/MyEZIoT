## MyEZIoT

With the increase of IoT devices, there are certain drawbacks that led to a slow adoption of IoT technology in commercial use, such as the complexity of IoT platforms available in the market, amount of technical background required to set up both the sensors and platform simultaneously and the incompatibilities and proprietary communication interfaces between major suppliers. Objective of the project is to create a platform to simplify the development and connectivity of IoT devices to make smart environments easy.

MyEZIoT is the product of a team of two final year students pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic. It comprises of an interactive web dashboard and a dedicated mobile application available for Android and iOS users. With an intuitive design and a focus in simplicity, MyEZIoT aims to solve all these problems faced by users to provide a quick, reliable and easy platform for remote monitoring of commercial areas such as factories, laboratories or offices, while ensuring that different sensors and devices are able to interoperate for a refined experience.
